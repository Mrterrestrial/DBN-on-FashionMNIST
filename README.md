# DBN-on-FashionMNIST
A Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a deep neural network that uses multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to learn hierarchical representations of input data in an unsupervised manner. Applying a DBN to the Fashion MNIST dataset is a common benchmark in machine learning to evaluate its ability to learn features from image data.
